Welcome to Episode 3 of Copilot Studio for Beginners! We're adding email capabilities to the conference room agent we built in Episode 2. Your agent won't just answer questions anymore - it'll take actions and send information directly to users.

This episode shows you how to add multiple tools to your agent and have it intelligently choose which one to use based on the conversation. All without writing code.
