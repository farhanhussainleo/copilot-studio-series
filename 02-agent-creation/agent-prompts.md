## Topic Creation Prompt

*This is the description used to create the International Rooms topic within Copilot Studio:*

```
Handle questions about international conference rooms. Ask the user which country their office is located in using multiple choice options (United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, India). If they select United States, inform them that you only have information about the Redmond, Washington office and they can contact conference-rooms-demo@outlook.com for assistance. For all other countries, inform them that you don't have information about international offices and they should contact their regional facilities team.
